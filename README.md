# Miscellaneous

Scripts created for course logistics, self-exploration, and fun.

(As of March 2020)


* ai_hw: an implementation of Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning.
* autoclick: a bland autoclicker to play with your favorite idle game.
* GD_v_SGD_demo: an interactive demo of why Stochastic Gradient descent is useful in certain types of optimization landscapes
* sorters: a survey and implementation of various sorting algorithms, and comparison of runtime
* surjections: a script that solve the problem of counting the number of surjections between two sets
* 4780_grade_tally: a script used to combine student information from two .csv files and produce a tally of grades and late days used on coursework.
* VocabQuizGen: an Excel Macro improvement of a vocabulary quiz generator. The original version requires human input to generate each sheet of quiz and print it manually; the improved, automated version parses a list of queries and automatically prints them sequentially, reducing human work. Implemented during my time at Seoul Language Institute.
